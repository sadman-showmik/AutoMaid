## Overview
AutoMaid is an autonomous home cleaning management system that keeps your space clean without direct effort from the user. It learns household habits, predicts cleaning needs, and cleans floors, surfaces, and air when necessary. The system optimizes cleaning schedules based on residents’ routines, providing a hygienic and comfortable environment while saving natural resources.

AutoMaid can integrate with smart home systems for lighting, heating, and notifications, depending on subscription packages.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Cleaning Management:** Floors, surfaces, and air are cleaned automatically.  
- **Predictive Habit Learning:** Learns daily, weekly, and special-day routines to schedule cleaning efficiently.  
- **Environment-Friendly:** Optimizes natural resource usage; non-toxic cleaning methods.  
- **Safety & Health Alerts:** Sends notifications for unusual events or emergencies.

## How It Works
1. **Sensors** detect physical, chemical, or biological parameters of the room.  
2. **Machine Learning** analyzes habits and patterns to predict cleaning needs.  
3. **Cleaning Execution:** System selects the best time, method, and location for cleaning.  
4. **Self-Learning:** AutoMaid improves its predictions based on past cleaning efficiency and habits.  
5. **Dashboard:** Displays cleaning history, upcoming schedules, and environmental data.
